Patch List:

   *Disable i2c HAL
     Due to conflict with zephyr i2c.h (I2C_SPEED_STANDARD and I2C_SPEED_FAST
     redefinition), deactivate Cube I2C HAL. This raises no issue since
     LL API is currently used for  I2C driver.
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/f4xx_hal_conf.h
    ST Bug tracker ID: NA. Not a cube issue

   *Disable new CAN API and enable Legacy API
     A new CAN API has been delivered on recent F4 cube.
     This new API breaks current CAN driver. Disable the new API and enable the
     legacy API.
     Disable related systematic warning message
    Impacted files:
     CMakeLists.txt
     drivers/include/f4xx_hal_conf.h
     drivers/src/Legacy/f4_hal_can.c

    *Use of (__packed uint32_t *) produces warning
      Using GNU 8.2.0, (__packed uint32_t *) generates warning.
      Replace with CMSIS macros __UNALIGNED_UINT32_READ and
      __UNALIGNED_UINT32_WRITE.
